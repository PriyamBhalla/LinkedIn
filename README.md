This is a Power BI dashboard created with the help of LinkedIn data which I requested from LinkedIn. This LinkedIn data dashboard can help to get your insights of the usage of LinkedIn and also help to gain insights about your activity in the LinkedIn.

You can request Data from LinkedIn as follows:
In LinkedIn go to Settings Then to Data Privacy Then to get copy of your data
